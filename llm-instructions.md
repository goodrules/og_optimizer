## üéØ Simplified Migration Plan: Work Package ‚Üí Oil & Gas Field Development Optimizer

### üìÅ Existing Codebase Foundation
The project builds upon the existing work package optimizer in the `local/` folder:
- **main.py**: Contains a complete OR-Tools scheduling system with:
  - Heuristic optimization using guided random search (`perturb_knobs` function)
  - Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty modeling
  - NiceGUI interface with real-time visualizations
  - Constraint-based scheduling with crew resource management

This existing architecture provides the foundation for migration to the oil & gas domain.

### üìä Simplified Architecture

Your existing code structure maps nicely to the oil & gas domain:

| Current Component | New Purpose | Key Changes |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Tasks ‚Üí Wells | Individual well entities | Production profiles instead of hours |
| Workers ‚Üí Rigs | Drilling resources | Rig count instead of crew types |
| Schedule ‚Üí Drilling Timeline | When to drill each well | Capital allocation over time |
| Cost ‚Üí NPV | Economic optimization | Revenue streams + decline curves |

### üîÑ Core Component Transformations

#### 1. **Simplified Data Model**

```python
# CURRENT: Tasks with dependencies
TASKS = [{"id": "T1", "hours": 40, "skill": "Pipefitter"...}]

# NEW: Texas oil wells with pre-validated locations
# Default: 5 leases with randomized well counts (5-32 per lease)
LEASES = [
    {
        "id": "MIDLAND_A",
        "basin": "Permian",
        "county": "Midland",
        "available_wells": 28,  # Randomly set between 5-32
        "royalty": 0.1875,  # Standard Texas royalty
        "working_interest": 0.80
    },
    {
        "id": "MARTIN_B",
        "basin": "Permian",
        "county": "Martin",
        "available_wells": 15,  # Randomly set between 5-32
        "royalty": 0.1875,
        "working_interest": 0.75
    },
    {
        "id": "REEVES_C",
        "basin": "Delaware",
        "county": "Reeves",
        "available_wells": 32,  # Randomly set between 5-32
        "royalty": 0.20,
        "working_interest": 0.80
    },
    {
        "id": "LOVING_D",
        "basin": "Delaware",
        "county": "Loving",
        "available_wells": 22,  # Randomly set between 5-32
        "royalty": 0.1875,
        "working_interest": 0.85
    },
    {
        "id": "HOWARD_E",
        "basin": "Permian",
        "county": "Howard",
        "available_wells": 12,  # Randomly set between 5-32
        "royalty": 0.20,
        "working_interest": 0.70
    }
]

# Wells are generated dynamically based on lease selection
WELL_TEMPLATE = {
    "base_cost": 7_500_000,  # Typical Texas horizontal well
    "ip_rate": 1000,  # boe/d (oil only for Texas focus)
    "decline_params": {
        "type": "hyperbolic",
        "di": 0.70,  # annual - typical Permian decline
        "b": 1.1
    },
    "eur_mboe": 400  # Conservative Texas oil EUR
}
```

#### 2. **Constraint Simplification**

```python
# CURRENT: Complex crew scheduling
model.AddCumulative(*buckets["Pipefitter"], pf_cap)

# NEW: Simple drilling constraints
- Max rigs available per month
- Total CAPEX budget
- Max wells per lease (pre-validated)
- Minimum production targets
```

#### 3. **OR-Tools Adaptation**

Transform from task scheduling to drilling sequence optimization:

```python
# Decision variables
wells_drilled[lease][month] = IntVar(0, max_wells_per_month)
rig_usage[month] = Sum(wells_drilled[*][month])

# Constraints
model.Add(rig_usage[month] <= available_rigs)
model.Add(Sum(wells_drilled[lease]) <= lease.available_wells)
model.Add(cumulative_capex[month] <= budget_limit)
```

#### 4. **Economic Engine Components**

New calculation modules needed:

```python
def calculate_production_profile(well, months=360):
    """Generate monthly production using decline curve"""
    
def calculate_well_npv(well, oil_price, discount_rate):
    """NPV for individual well"""
    
def calculate_field_economics(drilling_schedule, assumptions):
    """Aggregate NPV, IRR, payback period"""
```

### üèóÔ∏è Simplified Implementation Phases

|----------------|-------------|----------|

### üìä MVP Visualizations

1. **Drilling Schedule** (replaces Gantt)
   ```
   Timeline showing:
   - Which wells drill when
   - Rig allocation
   - Cumulative wells drilled
   ```

2. **Production Forecast** (new)
   ```
   Line chart:
   - Total field production over time
   - By lease breakdown
   - P10/P50/P90 bands
   ```

3. **Economics Dashboard** (replaces metrics card)
   ```
   KPIs:
   - NPV at different price scenarios
   - IRR
   - Payback period
   - Total CAPEX deployed
   ```

4. **Optimization History** (keep 3D plot)
   ```
   Axes:
   - X: NPV ($MM)
   - Y: EUR (MMboe)  
   - Z: Investment efficiency ($/boe)
   ```

### üîß Key Simplifications for MVP

1. **Pre-validated well locations**: Just specify count per lease (5-32 wells)
2. **Texas-specific type curves**: Permian/Delaware defaults with regional adjustments
3. **Horizontal rig focus**: 1-5 rigs suitable for horizontal drilling
4. **Oil-only economics**: Texas oil focus (gas/NGL monetized as oil equivalent)
5. **Texas regulatory framework**: Railroad Commission permits, standard royalties
6. **Regional defaults**: 5 Texas leases with randomized well counts on initialization

### üöÄ Development Priority

1. **Start with deterministic optimization** (Adapt OR-Tools from `local/main.py`)
2. **Add Monte Carlo uncertainty** (Leverage existing MC simulation approach)
3. **Implement heuristic optimization** (Use existing `perturb_knobs` pattern)
4. **Enhance UI** (Build on existing NiceGUI structure)
5. **Add Gemini** (Natural language interface)
6. **Future: Integrate Vizier** (Replace heuristic with Bayesian optimization)

### üîß Implementation Strategy

The migration leverages the robust architecture already present in `local/main.py`:

1. **Constraint Solver**: The existing OR-Tools CP-SAT model provides a proven foundation for handling complex scheduling constraints. We'll adapt it from crew scheduling to rig allocation.

2. **Heuristic Optimization**: The current `perturb_knobs` approach with guided random search has demonstrated effectiveness. This will be our primary optimization method before considering more advanced techniques.

3. **Uncertainty Modeling**: The Monte Carlo simulation framework is already battle-tested and can be directly adapted for oil price volatility and operational uncertainties.

4. **UI Architecture**: The NiceGUI implementation provides real-time updates, interactive controls, and sophisticated visualizations that map directly to oil & gas metrics.

This approach maximizes code reuse while focusing on the core value: optimizing drilling sequences for maximum NPV under capital constraints.
